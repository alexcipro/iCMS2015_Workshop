This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Enter the data
ENERGY <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexcipro/iCMS2015_Workshop/master/Data%20sets/NRG_Data.csv", head = TRUE, sep = "," )
```

## Summary statistics

```{r}
head(ENERGY)
summary(ENERGY$NRG)
summary(ENERGY$GDP)
```

## Plot histograms

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1,2)) 
hist(ENERGY$NRG)
hist(ENERGY$GDP)
```

## Plot NRG versus GDP

Explanatory text will be here...

```{r, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1,1)) 
plot(ENERGY$GDP,ENERGY$NRG, xlab = "GDP (Million Euro)", ylab = "Energy consumption (thousand TOE)", main = "Correlation between energy consumption and GDP")
```

The end of the report!!!
